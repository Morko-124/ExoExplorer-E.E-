ExoExplorer

ExoExplorer is an exoplanet analysis and visualization project that combines astronomical data and machine learning techniques to explore the universe in search of habitable worlds. This project is designed to provide an intuitive interface for querying and analyzing exoplanet data, recognizing exoplanet images, and assessing the probability of habitability based on key characteristics.

Main Features

- Planetary Data Query:
Access detailed information about exoplanets by star system using data obtained from Exoplanet Kyoto Archive database.
Perform queries and visualize data interactively.

- Habitability Analysis:
Estimate the probability of habitability of an exoplanet based on its physical and orbital characteristics.
Present the results clearly in the user interface.

- Data Visualization:
Offer an animated visualization of exoplanets, showing their rotation and key data about each one.
